            <h1>ABOUT THE LEGEND</h1>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                <strong>Allah Rakha Rahman</strong> was born as A. S. Dileep Kumar in Madras, Tamil Nadu, on 6 January 1967.
                His father, R. K. Shekhar, from a Mudaliar family, was a film-score composer and conductor for Tamil and Malayalam films.<br>
                Rahman began studying piano at age <strong>four</strong>. He assisted his father in the studio, playing the piano and learning about music production.<br><br>
                
                After his father's death when Rahman was nine years old, the rental of his father's musical equipment provided his family's income. Raised by his mother, Kareema (born Kashturi), Rahman, who was studying at Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan, had to work to support his family, which led him to routinely miss classes and fail exams.<br><br> 
                
                In an interview in 2012, Rahman said that his mother was summoned and was told to take him to the streets of Kodambakkam to beg and not to send him to school.<br><br> 
                
                Rahman attended another school called MCN for a year, and later joined the Madras Christian College Higher Secondary School, where he was admitted based on his musical talent. He formed a band with his high school classmates. However, after discussing with his mother, he later dropped out of school to pursue a career as a full-time musician.<br><br> 
                
                Rahman was a keyboard player and arranger for bands such as <strong>Roots</strong> (with childhood friend and percussionist Sivamani, John Anthony, Suresh Peters, JoJo, and Raja) and founded the Chennai-based rock group <strong>Nemesis Avenue</strong>. He mastered the keyboard, piano, synthesizer, harmonium, and guitar, and was particularly interested in the synthesizer because it was the "ideal combination of music and technology."<br><br> 
                
                Rahman began his early musical training under Master Dhanraj, and at age 11 began playing in the orchestra of Malayalam composer M. K. Arjunan. He soon began working with other composers, such as M. S. Viswanathan, Vijaya Bhaskar, Ilaiyaraaja, Ramesh Naidu, Vijay Anand, Hamsalekha, and Rajâ€“Koti. Rahman accompanied Zakir Hussain, Kunnakudi Vaidyanathan, and L. Shankar on world tours and obtained a scholarship from Trinity College London to the Trinity College of Music.<br><br>
                
                During his early career, Rahman assisted many music directors by playing keyboard and synthesizer. One of the notable works includes a Malayalam film, <em>Ramji Rao Speaking</em>, released in 1989, where Rahman and Sivamani programmed a song called "Kalikalam" for the music director S. Balakrishnan.
